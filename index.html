					<h3 id="h1"> Golden Retrievers</h3> 
					<p id="p1"> The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed 
					of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl
					such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting 
					and shooting parties,and were named 'retriever'
					because of their ability to retrieve shot
					game undamaged (soft mouth). Golden Retrievers 
					have an instinctive love of water, and are easy 
					to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.
					They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat 
					that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, 
					and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and 
					repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to
					residency in suburban or country environments.
					Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, 
					they should be housed in a fenced area because of their 
					instinctual tendency to roam. They shed copiously, 
					particularly at the change of seasons, and require 
					fairly regular grooming.</p>
